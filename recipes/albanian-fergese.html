    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    <em>Fërgesë</em> is a dish made with tomatoes, onions, roasted red peppers, feta cheese, and yogurt. The vegetables are all stewed together and then combined with a feta-yogurt roux that adds a creaminess to the dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 roasted & diced red bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 diced onion</li>
        <li>150g feta cheese</li>
        <li>400g diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>20g flour</li>
        <li>20g butter</li>
        <li>40g greek yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp basil</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sweat the onion in a small drop of olive oil until softened - about 3 minutes, then remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Simmer the red bell peppers, tomatoes and basil on a medium to high heat for 10 minutes - the mixture should have thickened with little liquid remaining. Mix in the onion and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>In a separate small saucepan melt the butter. Mix in the flour to form a roux. Crumble in the feta while stirring quickly. Once all has melted, you should have a thick texture - add the yogurt.</li>
        <li>Mix the feta and yogurt mixture into it into the pepper and tomatoes mixture. Season with the Chilli flakes, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Split into 2 dishes and cook on 180 degrees for 30 minutes. Leave to cool slightly before serving - best served with crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
