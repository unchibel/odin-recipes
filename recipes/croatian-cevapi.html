        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        <em>Cevapi</em> or <em>cevapcici</em> are grilled sausages made of a mixture of ground beef and pork, seasoned with lots of garlic and paprika. Originally this kind of sausages were made with ground lamb, but nowadays beef or pork are more common.
        </p>
        <p>
        They are very common not only in Croatia but pretty much in all the other former Yugoslavian countries. Also common in countries around former Yugoslavia, like Romania (<em>mici</em>), Bulgaria (<em>kebaptscheta</em>) or Albania (<em>kebape</em>).
